# XRCalendar


Calling All Extinction Rebellion Rebels!
Tired of searching through countless facebook pages for events? why not just have them all in one place?

Well luckily there is XR-Calendar which i have made in an effort to assist with the coordination of events,
free to use and free to download.
local groups please contact me if your page's events are not beings synced.

if your computer warns you about the security concerns for downloading this XR-Calendar.zip, its because i have not signed the installer with a certificate authority. Hey! that costs money, 
but you can donate to me within the app itself if you feel strongly about resolving this issue!

Rebel for Life everywhere!


##To Install
* Download and Extract XR-Calendar.zip
* Double click the setup.exe
* Find some events!
